            <img src="ddc_1.jpg" width=250px height=250px >
            <p> I have done my Intermediate in Sri Chaitanya Junior College. Back in the day, it was pretty well known for its
                IIT preparatory course. Many have secured ranks from this college. It is just like any other college whith a building
                and it had different batches like semi-residential, residential, day-scholar.

            <h3>Life at SCJC</h3>
            <img src="inter.jpg" width=30% height=30%>
            <p>I was a semi-residential student. The timings were pretty brutal, 6:00 am to 8:00 pm. These people in the photograph have 
                made this life easy for me. We all were just caught up with studies but we managed to enjoy as much as we could. We used to
                smuggle junk food into the campus and we used to eat it secretly. As it was a hard-working periods of out life, I did as much
                as I could. Even if I couldn't secure IIT rank, I am still happy that I did my best with my friends always supporting me.
