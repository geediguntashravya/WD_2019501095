        <h3>Life at SAGHS</h3>
        <p>My whole school life has been with this school. I have made life-long friends here. We have been together for 13 years.
            We had so many precious experieneces and memories that can never be forgotten. This picture is from the golden jubilee event that we all met for in 2015.
            I have participated in countless events and made best memories here. It is almost like a second home for me and I am proud to be an Annite.
