            <h3>About KMIT</h3>
            <img src="kmit_clg.PNG" width=30% height=30%>
            <p> Kehsav Memorial Institute of Technology is one of the top CSE colleges in Telangana. It is very well equipped with latest technologies. 
                It helps the students to think out of the box by encouraging them in participating various tech related events.
                The unique feature of KMIT is its placement training. We have FS-Finishing School, which trains all branch students
                to get ready for placements. With cultural fests, different clubs, KMIT is growing more and expanding its branches.

            <h3>Life at KMIT</h3>
            <img src="kmitfrns.JPG" width=30% height=30%>
            <p>This is what my life at KMIT looks like. I belong to CSE branch.All these are my classmates. We have been togetehr for four long years.
                We have had pretty great and tough times and stuck through them together. All have headed towards their future and I am proud of all of them.
                Many have been placed with decent packages. Few, like me have been pursuing higher studies. We the batch of 2015-19 have promised to have a meet once every alternate year.
                I miss my friends sometimes but the memories with them always remain within me.
