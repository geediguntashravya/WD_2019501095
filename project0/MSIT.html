            <p> The reason for me to join MSIT is because of its unique way of teaching students,i.e., learning by doing. 
                I have joined MSIT at IIITH campus.
                The campus looks beautiful.

            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p> My experience in MSIT has been very great so far. I have done things which I have never imagined in past.
                I have worked on so many projects as a part of the course that I have enough experience to handle projects once I get placed.
                All thanks to the mentors and PCs who have helped me in every step.
                Soft skills mentors helped me in improving my communication skills and professional behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alumni meets have been really helpful regarding placements. I couldn't have asked for a better work environment.

            <img src="msitpic.jpg" width=20% height=30%>
            <p>This is what my life at MSIT looks like. It is filled with all these amazing people with such great talent. 
                My mentors help me grow every step closer to my goal. 
                My peers help me relive me of my stress. They also help me when I'm stuck at any point. 
                As hostel life is a new phase for me, all my friends have really been like my family helping and supporting me all the way.
                I wouldn't trade this experience for anything in my life.
