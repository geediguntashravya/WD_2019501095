# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is about the four phases of my life. My schooling, college, graduation and post graduation.

My whole project has 5 html pages, 4 css files and 1 scss file.
index.html is my main webpage in which I have given links to the other four html pages. I have implemented index.html using basic html/css prpoerties. The styles.css is the css file included in this page.

Then comes my school page. I have implemented this page using bootstrapping. I have also additionally added a button feature which will generate the link to official school website.

The next page is intermediate. This page has been implemented using sass. I have done my styling in scss file and with the help of built-in tool I was able to convert sass file into css file and used that link in my html page.

The third is my B.tech page. This page is a simple implementation using all basic styles such as tables, unordered list, div tags and their properties like class, id etc.

The final html page is my PG. This was also implemeted abiding to the requirements of project 0.
